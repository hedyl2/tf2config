echo - Manual Selection -
echo To manually select a file or directory, type "'bind = '" followed by the corresponding
echo "number of the file or folder, followed by the appropriate select command:"
echo "'hldjsf'" if selecting a file, or "'hldjsd'" if selecting a directory.
echo "Usage:"
echo " 'bind = [number]; hldjsf OR hldjsd'"
echo "Example: this will load the 13th audio file in the list:"
echo " 'bind = 13; hldjsf'"
echo 
echo - Searching by Name -
echo To search for and select a file by name, type "'bind = '" followed by the partial or
echo entire name of the file, followed by the "'hldjsf'" command.
echo To search for and select a directory, follow the same process as above but also append a "'\'" to
echo the end of the search name and follow it with the "'hldjsd'" command instead.
echo Be sure to place the name in quotations if it contains any spaces or other non-alphanumeric characters,
echo (or you can replace all spaces with the '*' character instead).
echo Also, remember to seperate all adjacent commands with the command seperator "';'".
echo HLDJ will select the first file or folder within the current directory that matches part or all of the name entered.
echo "Usage:"
echo " 'bind = [search name]; hldjsf OR hldjsd'"
echo "Example: this will find and load an audio file named 'MyAudio.wav' in the current directory:"
echo " 'bind = myaud; hldjsf'"
echo 
echo "- Advanced Searching: Search in Path by Name -"
echo You can specify that a search should be conducted in a directory relative to the current directory
echo by providing the relative path of that directory from the current one, followed by the search name.
echo A path can be formed much like in Windows, using a combination of backslashes and directory names.
echo "Usage:"
echo " 'bind = [relative path\search name]; hldjsf OR hldjsd'"
echo "Example: this will find and load an audio file named 'MyVoice.wav'"
echo "in the sub-directory 'Voices\Me\' (relative to the current directory):"
echo " 'bind = Voices\Me\myv; hldjsf'"
echo 
echo "- Advanced Searching: Original Audio Directory -"
echo You can specify that a search should be conducted from your original audio directory
echo (the audio directory you specified for the game in Setup), instead of the current one,
echo by prefixing the search string with the '$' character. This character acts as
echo the full path of the original audio directory and can be used much like any full path.
echo You can append sub-directories or filenames to the end of it to specify file or directory searches.
echo If used by itself, it simulates the "'hldjre'" command, resetting the current directory
echo back to the original one.
echo "Usage:"
echo " 'bind = $\[relative path\search name]; hldjsf OR hldjsd'"
echo "Example: this will find and load an audio file named 'MyVoice.wav'"
echo "in the sub-directory 'Voices\Me\' (relative to the original audio directory):"
echo " 'bind = $\Voices\Me\myv; hldjsf'"
echo 
echo "- Advanced Selecting: Exact Names -"
echo If you know the exact relative path and name of the file or directory
echo that you wish to load, you can prefix the search string with the '>' character.
echo HLDJ will search for the exact relative path and name provided (with or without
echo the file extension), so be sure it is entered correctly! Unlike the other previous
echo search methods, this method will not change your current audio directory or play index
echo (unless a directory is specified). This means that after loading an audio file using this
echo method you will still remain at the same index in the same directory as you were before.
echo "Usage:"
echo " 'bind = >[relative path\exact name]; hldjsf OR hldjsd'"
echo "Example: this will load the audio file 'MyVoice.wav'"
echo "in the sub-directory 'Voices\Me\' (relative to the current directory):"
echo " 'bind = >Voices\Me\MyVoice; hldjsf'"
echo 
echo "- Advanced Searching: Usage Tips -"
echo All of the above techniques can be used in conjuction with each other.
echo For example, the following will change the current directory
echo "to the directory 'Voices\My Voice\' (relative to the original audio directory):"
echo " 'bind = >$\Voices\My*Voice\; hldjsd'"
echo Use the 'Exact Name' search method when you want to load an audio file while still
echo remaining at the current play index of your current directory.
echo 
echo These are just some example uses of HLDJ commands, but there are many more
echo combinations and uses for these commands, especially through the use of scripting.
echo Experiment around and see what you can come up with!
